## Introduction:
This project is an analysis of a company called Netflix. It is an attempt to help the company understand what their data is saying about their services and their customers preferences to the services rendered and to also help them come up with insights for informed decisions and recommendations that will bring about more success to the company. This is a project carried by a team called the Data Titans

## Purpose of study:
* Identify the most popular shows and movies on Netflix based on viewership data.
* Analyze viewer behavior and preferences to understand which genres and types of content are most popular.
* Investigate the relationship between user ratings and viewership data to understand how ratings impact 
  viewership.
* Evaluate the performance of Netflix's original content versus licensed content.
* Identify potential areas for growth and expansion for the company.
  

## Assumptions, challenges and complaints:
 Kaggle.com had various types of datasets concerning Netflix that could answer different questions and objectives but we barely found any that could answer the specific objective questions of this study and as such we had to source further.
As a result of the objective of this study and in order to limit our self within the scope of the study, we did not need to make any transformations from the dataset we got.
  

## Skills demonstrated:

### Data sourcing:
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from youtube. We had various options of datasets to choose for this analysis but we settled for one that has a high chance of answering the particular questions and objectives of this study. The dataset contains 8785 rows and 12 columns which covers the period between 1925 to 2021 and after investigating we can deduce that there are no duplicate entries nor null entries and as such the dataset was loaded into Power Bi and the analysis process began.[View dataset here](https://github.com/SEYI-FASE/Data-Titans/files/14607466/netflix_titles.csv)


## Analysis:

The Image above shows the overall view of the analysis of the Netflix dataset according to the viewers and customers preferences, global engagements and ratings. It is determined by various categories which include viewers ratings, viewers choices on the type of Tv programme preferred, viewers region and by Tv programme trend type.

This visual above shows that the company produced two varying programmes which are movies and tv shows where the movies has a rate of 6119 unlike Tv shows which is 2666. The company produced more of the movies option from the year 2011 and has constantly increased in the numbers ever since.


![Ratings by country](https://github.com/SEYI-FASE/Data-Titans/assets/134503256/f0d0bfd5-6e46-4abe-a955-77b17576a93c)

As seen in previous image the movies option produced more and also in this visual we can see that out of the 93 geographical locations used in the study, the movies option was evident in 76 of the countries in which North America topped the chart.


## Findings:
* ![Popular movie](https://github.com/SEYI-FASE/Data-Titans/assets/134503256/f673b810-728e-471f-936b-a1b0148f7fcd)![Popular tv ](https://github.com/SEYI-FASE/Data-Titans/assets/134503256/b19a9c03-b952-47f5-a9e1-08c6ca42f670)


Images above show that the most popular Tv show is the Kids Tv also the most popular movie is the drama, international movies. We can also deduce from the visuals above that the most popular Tv show and Movie based on viewers preferences are the same  which is TV-MA (TV Matured Audience).


* ![Correlation](https://github.com/SEYI-FASE/Data-Titans/assets/134503256/895ea954-ee2c-42cb-bded-ae0ea1af9693)

Investigation shows that there is minimal correlation in the relationship between user ratings and viewership data as Netflix as a company caters to various groups and classes of people with varying preferences.

* ![Movies by year](https://github.com/SEYI-FASE/Data-Titans/assets/134503256/0f055197-6799-4c5a-9344-763e603232d8)

Netflix has maintained a consistent growth and focus in the movie production over tv shows from the year 1925 with a significant increase from the year 2011 upwards.


## Recommendations:
* One main recommendation to enable a continuous success rate in the ratings of the viewers is to concentrate on the strengths which has been identified as the movie category, particularly with the TV – MA preference. 
* The Tv- shows is not doing bad either but more attention should be focused to the Kids Tv genre with preference TV -MA as it has the highest number of ratings in the category and has a high possibility to pull more engagement if more productions in this genre are made.
