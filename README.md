## Introduction:

## Purpose of study:
* Objectives:	
* Identify the most popular shows and movies on Netflix based on viewership data.
* Analyze viewer behavior and preferences to understand which genres and types of content are most popular.
* Investigate the relationship between user ratings and viewership data to understand how ratings impact viewership.
* Evaluate the performance of Netflix's original content versus licensed content.
* Identify potential areas for growth and expansion for the company.

## Assumptions,Challenges and complaints:
  Due to the way the dataset was sourced for and the platform in which it was gotten, we were limited and this made it unable for us to make some transformations to the dataset that will enable us derive more insights as we would have done. We had a number of datasets to explore from kaggle.com but the varying ones available on the platform were not suitable enough to answer the questions purposed for the success of the study. 

## Skills demonstrated:

* ### Data sourcing:
 The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from youtube. We had various options of datasets to choose for this analysis but we settled    for one that had a high chance of answering the particular questions and objectives of this study. ![View dataset here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jiejenn/e/131884)
* ### Data cleaning:
The dataset could not be cleaned and was not needed in this sense and as such we used the dataset as it is.
