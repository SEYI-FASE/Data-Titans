## Introduction:

## Purpose of study:
* Identify the most popular shows and movies on Netflix based on viewership data.
* Analyze viewer behavior and preferences to understand which genres and types of content are most popular.
* Investigate the relationship between user ratings and viewership data to understand how ratings impact viewership.
* Evaluate the performance of Netflix's original content versus licensed content.
* Identify potential areas for growth and expansion for the company.

## Assumptions, challenges and complaints:
  Due to the way the dataset was sourced for and the platform in which it was gotten, we were limited and this made it unable for us to make some transformations to the dataset that will enable us derive more insights as we would have done. We had a number of datasets to explore from kaggle.com but the varying ones available on the platform were not suitable enough to answer the questions purposed for the success of the study.

## Skills demonstrated:

### Data sourcing:
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from youtube. We had various options of datasets to choose for this analysis but we settled for one that has a high chance of answering the particular questions and objectives of this study. The dataset contains 8785 rows and 12 columns and after investigating we can deduce that there are no duplicate entries or null entries and as such the dataset was loaded into Power Bi and the analysis process began.[View dataset here](https://github.com/SEYI-FASE/Data-Titans/files/14607466/netflix_titles.csv)

The Image above shows the overall view of the analysis of the Netflix dataset according to the viewers and customers preference and ratings. It is determined by various categories which include viewers ratings, by the viewers choices on the type of Tv programme preferred, by viewers region and by Tv programme trend type.

This visual above shows that the Tv programme most preferred and most viewed by the netflix customers is the Movies options with an overall view rate of 6119 unlike Tv shows which is viewed 2666 times. The love for the Movies option started experiencing more views from the year 2011 and has experienced increased numbers ever since then.

As seen in previous image the movies option was the most preferred and also in this visual we can see that out of the 93 geographical locations used in the study, the movies option was viewed in about 76 of the countries with North America topping the chart.
