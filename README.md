## Introduction:
This project is an analysis of a company called Netflix. It is an attempt to help the company understand what their data is saying about their services and their customers preferences to the services rendered and to also help them come up with insights for informed decisions and recommendations that will bring about more success to the company. This is a project carried by a team called the Data Titans

## Purpose of study:
* Identify the most popular shows and movies on Netflix based on viewership data.
* Analyze viewer behavior and preferences to understand which genres and types of content are most popular.
* Investigate the relationship between user ratings and viewership data to understand how ratings impact 
  viewership.
* Evaluate the performance of Netflix's original content versus licensed content.
* Identify potential areas for growth and expansion for the company.
  

## Assumptions, challenges and complaints:
  Due to the way the dataset was sourced for and the platform in which it was gotten, we were limited and this made it unable for us to make some transformations to the dataset that will enable us derive more insights as we would have done. We had a number of datasets to explore from kaggle.com but the varying ones available on the platform were not suitable enough to answer the questions purposed for the success of the study.
  

## Skills demonstrated:

### Data sourcing:
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from youtube. We had various options of datasets to choose for this analysis but we settled for one that has a high chance of answering the particular questions and objectives of this study. The dataset contains 8785 rows and 12 columns and after investigating we can deduce that there are no duplicate entries or null entries and as such the dataset was loaded into Power Bi and the analysis process began.[View dataset here](https://github.com/SEYI-FASE/Data-Titans/files/14607466/netflix_titles.csv)

The Image above shows the overall view of the analysis of the Netflix dataset according to the viewers and customers preference, global engagement and ratings. It is determined by various categories which include viewers ratings, by the viewers choices on the type of Tv programme preferred, by viewers region and by Tv programme trend type.

This visual above shows that the company produced two varying programmes whwich are movies and tv shows where the movies has a rate of 6119 unlike Tv shows which is 2666. The company produced more of the movies option from the year 2011 and has constantly increased in the numbers ever since.

As seen in previous image the movies option produced more and also in this visual we can see that out of the 93 geographical locations used in the study, the movies option was evident in 76 of the countries in which North America topped the chart.
